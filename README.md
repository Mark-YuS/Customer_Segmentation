# Customer Segmentation | Hypothesis Testing | KMeans

## Background
This project aims to segment customers using the KMeans Clustering Algorithm, an unsupervised machine learning technique. By analyzing a dataset of supermarket mall customers, we explore how to effectively identify target groups for more focused marketing strategies.

## Data
The dataset [Mall_Customers.csv](https://github.com/Mark-YuS/Customer_Segmentation/blob/main/Mall_Customers.csv) includes basic information like Customer ID, age, gender, annual income, and spending scores, which reflect customer behavior and purchasing data.

## Problem Statement
Our objective is to identify easily targetable customer segments to enhance marketing efforts and resource allocation.

## Project Objectives
- To segment customers using the KMeans algorithm.
- To derive actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies.
- To apply real-world marketing strategies based on customer segmentation.

## Usage
Follow the provided code for conducting customer segmentation analysis, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, and clustering.
